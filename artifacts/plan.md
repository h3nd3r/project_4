### Layout Considerations

- **Flexbox vs. Grid**: Flexbox is recommended for this layout due to its simplicity and ease of centering elements both vertically and horizontally. Grid could be used for more complex layouts but might be overkill for this design.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the design is responsive, adjusting the layout for different screen sizes, especially for mobile devices.
- **Background Shapes**: These can be implemented using absolute positioning and z-index to layer them behind the main content.
